Since these are hand made, each one will have it&#39;s own characteristics and no two will look exactly alike and will differ slightly from the photo. This is NOT a barrel head.  It is made to look similar to a aged barrel head, but is a much less expensive option.   I will be offering this in other stain and appearance options. Feel free to request special options also.  I can do almost anything custom with my products. \n\nMade to accommodate the 8 collectable cork stoppers found in the Blanton&#39;s full sets.\nDrill holes for stoppers may be dark or light color depending on the wood (does not show either way since your stoppers fill them) \n\nPlease allow 1 to 2 weeks to build this item**** \n****(Sometimes I can complete items much sooner, depending on my current schedule or may have some ready to ship now)\nPlease feel free to contact me with any questions.","creation_tsz":1464959047,"ending_tsz":1475499847,"original_creation_tsz":1456936419,"last_modified_tsz":1464959047,"price":"59.98","currency_code":"USD","quantity":2,"tags":["Blanton's","Blantons","bourbon","whiskey","barrel","stave","bar","display","rustic","half barrel display","barrel head","Lazy susan","horseshoe"],"category_path":["Housewares","Home Decor"],"category_path_ids":[69150425,68892008],"materials":[],"shop_section_id":null,"featured_rank":2,"state_tsz":1456936419,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/270622470\/blantons-bourbon-bottle-cork-stopper?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":471,"num_favorers":4,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":5,"processing_max":10,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":["Country Western","Rustic"],"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":1002,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living","Home D\u00e9cor"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":933444890,"hex_code":"646054","red":100,"green":96,"blue":84,"hue":45,"saturation":16,"brightness":39,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1457040995,"listing_id":270622470,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/106\/0\/12265183\/il_75x75.933444890_m1fg.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/106\/0\/12265183\/il_170x135.933444890_m1fg.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/106\/0\/12265183\/il_570xN.933444890_m1fg.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/106\/0\/12265183\/il_fullxfull.933444890_m1fg.jpg","full_height":1190,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":932605736,"hex_code":"5D574B","red":93,"green":87,"blue":75,"hue":40,"saturation":19,"brightness":36,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1456936419,"listing_id":270622470,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/129\/0\/12265183\/il_75x75.932605736_s9ll.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/129\/0\/12265183\/il_170x135.932605736_s9ll.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/129\/0\/12265183\/il_570xN.932605736_s9ll.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/129\/0\/12265183\/il_fullxfull.932605736_s9ll.jpg","full_height":1190,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":932605852,"hex_code":"544D44","red":84,"green":77,"blue":68,"hue":34,"saturation":19,"brightness":32,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1456936420,"listing_id":270622470,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/107\/0\/12265183\/il_75x75.932605852_i4dl.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/107\/0\/12265183\/il_170x135.932605852_i4dl.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/107\/0\/12265183\/il_570xN.932605852_i4dl.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/107\/0\/12265183\/il_fullxfull.932605852_i4dl.jpg","full_height":1460,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":995396813,"hex_code":"84673D","red":132,"green":103,"blue":61,"hue":35,"saturation":53,"brightness":51,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1459296629,"listing_id":270622470,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/107\/0\/12265183\/il_75x75.995396813_cm09.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/107\/0\/12265183\/il_170x135.995396813_cm09.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/107\/0\/12265183\/il_570xN.995396813_cm09.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/107\/0\/12265183\/il_fullxfull.995396813_cm09.jpg","full_height":1486,"full_width":1500}],"Shop":{"shop_id":12265183,"shop_name":"WhiskeyCartel","user_id":79682683,"creation_tsz":1451925240,"title":"Rustic hand built home bar & pub products","announcement":"Building rustic custom hand built bars, signs, pubs, whiskey barrel products and accessories for your home, barn, garage, basement, or man cave.

My name is Amy, and my husband, Tyler and I are the owners and creators of Liquid Courage. We have been selling online since 2003.

We have been goofing around making all sorts of arts, crafts, scrapbooks, and clothing for many years and decided to combine my hobby with my online business experience. \r\n\r\nTyler has an Accounting degree from Tennessee Technological University, and I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in Marketing and an MBA in Accounting from TTU as well.

We spent a couple of years working for &quot;the man&quot;...at a desk eight hours a day...fifty weeks a year.\r\n\r\nWe finally decided to follow our dream of becoming entrepreneurs, pursue our passion, and determine our own future with hands on approach.

Your ring will have a similar look to those in the pictures - charred oak wood - but each ring is a unique piece of wood with it&#39;s own unique patterning with no two exactly alike!  Please note the variability in coloring in the photos - due to the charring process, your ring may be lighter or darker than the first image!\n\nThis is the charred wood option for this ring - if you&#39;d prefer a lighter ring, check out my natural version here: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/278011450\/\n\nAfter a Jack Daniels barrel is no longer of use to the distillery, it is sold to a number of craftsmen who make everything from planters to knife handles from the wood - or, in this case, a solid wood ring.   I purchase the barrels straight from the distillery general store and have them shipped to my doorstep, where I dismantle them into individual staves to be cut into rings.\n  \n\nEach ring is hand polished and finished with several layers of cyanoacrylate.  While many crafters use oils and waxes to finish their rings, cyanoacrylate provides a stronger bond within the wood grain, provides protection from water, and reduces the likelihood of scratching - a common issue with other finishing materials.\n\nTo order a pair of rings:  add the first ring to your cart with the correct size\/shape information, return to this page, then add another ring with the second size\/shape information.\n\nDimensions:\nRing Size:  5-13.  If you need a larger or smaller size, please inquire using the &quot;Ask a Question&quot; button in the Cart area of the page.\nWidth:  5mm-9mm\nShape:  Rounded or flat profile.  Most people find that the rounded profile is more comfortable during the initial phase of getting used to wearing your ring, but this is largely an aesthetic choice.\n\nProcessing information:  Please allow 3-5 business days to create your ring prior to shipping.

Charges vary depending on the length of the engraving and are subject to the terms of customized orders.  Contact me for further details or to set up a custom listing to do engraving work.\n\nSIZING DETAILS\nSizes are in standard US ring sizes.  The first exchange for sizing is free for US buyers.  Non-US buyers must pay additional shipping charges for exchanges due to sizing.\n\nIf you are unsure of your ring size, it is recommended to have your finger sized by a jeweler, or to try an online ring sizing guide such as findmyringsize.com\n\nCARE INSTRUCTIONS\nAvoid using acetone-based cleaners like nail polish remover as this will destroy the ring&#39;s finish.  Clean with a wet cloth or paper towel.\n\nThe finish on your wood ring may eventually scratch and need repair.  While it may sound intimidating, this process is very easy and only requires a few supplies - liquid superglue, paper towels, and sand paper or polishing grits.  For detailed step-by-step instructions, please send me a message and I would be happy to provide them!\n\nGIFT WRAPPING AND PACKAGING\nRings are placed inside of a small AMAC (transparent plastic) jewelry box (bamboo rings come in a sustainably produced cardboard box) lined with cotton.  Orders are sent with a receipt-style packing slip using 100% recycled paper inside of a brown cushioned mailing envelope made from recycled newspaper.  If you are sending this as a gift and prefer not to have the purchase details in the package, please indicate this at time of purchase.  We do not offer additional gift wrapping at this time.\n\nRETURNS\nContact must be made with me prior to returns to ensure any issues are handled prior to shipping and to alert me to look for a package.  Returned rings should be placed inside their original jewelry box and then placed into a cushioned mailing envelope (available in the shipping supplies at your local post office).  Shipping may be done via USPS First Class for locations within the US to provide a cheap option that still provides tracking information.  Canada residents are strongly encouraged to utilize shipping with tracking and insurance for your protection in the case of a lost or stolen package.\n\nDAMAGED OR LOST ITEMS DURING SHIPPING\nPlease contact me immediately if you suspect a package has been lost or misdelivered.  Make certain that you&#39;ve checked with family members and neighbors, and looked in likely spots where a package may have been left.  Call your local post office in the case of a misdelivery so that they can track down your package and correct the delivery.\n\nIf your item has been damaged during shipping, you must keep both the damaged item and packaging, be willing to take photos of the damage, and fill out forms from our insurer in order to process your replacement\/refund in a timely manner.","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1458102341,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/HawkinsHandicrafts?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/073\/0\/11484887\/iusb_760x100.16085161_ex88.jpg","num_favorers":187,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/110\/0\/11484887\/isla_fullxfull.17888498_gki638da.jpg","is_using_structured_policies":true,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":true,"has_unstructured_policies":true,"custom_shops_state":1}},{"listing_id":275084164,"state":"active","user_id":59330769,"category_id":68887312,"title":"Old Fashioned Recipe Print | Mixed Drink Art | Home Bar Art | Whiskey | chelle belle inspired","description":"Every original chelle belle inspired work is carefully hand-painted and hand-lettered with love.  \n \nPrint Details:\nThis is a print of my original acrylic and hand-lettered artwork.

They are called s\u0101j\u0101t (\u0635\u0627\u062c\u0627\u062a) in Arabic. They are a percussion instrument used in accompaniment to tribal\/belly dance. \n\nUnlike traditional zils, these are made from wood instead of metal. They produce a loud clicking\/clapping sound instead of the traditional metallic ring. A set consists of four zils, two per hand. My zils are 2.5&quot; in diameter (6.5cm). They have two 5\/8&quot; slots for elastic (1.5cm). Note: zils come WITHOUT elastic. \n\nThe zil&#39;s sound depends on size, shape of the resonant chamber, strike face, and the density of the wood. \n\nThese zils are made from Red Oak and bossed with Wenge (a type of ebony). They are very hard and very durable and should last the user a lifetime. They have a large strike face and produce a very sharp bright clicking sound. They are handmade in my woodshop here in Palmer, Alaska.","creation_tsz":1464960419,"ending_tsz":1475501219,"original_creation_tsz":1454117031,"last_modified_tsz":1464960419,"price":"40.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":3,"tags":["zil","zill","finger cymbal","tribal","dance","bellydance","turkish dance"],"category_path":["Accessories"],"category_path_ids":[69150467],"materials":["Red Oak","Wenge"],"shop_section_id":15969082,"featured_rank":1,"state_tsz":1462479502,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/266059019\/zil-finger-cymbals-bourbon-whiskey?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":533,"num_favorers":21,"shipping_template_id":9329127344,"processing_min":3,"processing_max":5,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2016","item_weight":"5","item_weight_units":null,"item_length":"8","item_width":"4","item_height":"0.5","item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":["Tribal"],"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":1,"taxonomy_path":["Accessories"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":920262197,"hex_code":"9C6957","red":156,"green":105,"blue":87,"hue":16,"saturation":44,"brightness":61,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1455171872,"listing_id":266059019,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/119\/0\/6665208\/il_75x75.920262197_1m5q.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/119\/0\/6665208\/il_170x135.920262197_1m5q.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/119\/0\/6665208\/il_570xN.920262197_1m5q.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/119\/0\/6665208\/il_fullxfull.920262197_1m5q.jpg","full_height":1458,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":912826887,"hex_code":"A46D53","red":164,"green":109,"blue":83,"hue":19,"saturation":49,"brightness":64,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1454117031,"listing_id":266059019,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/104\/0\/6665208\/il_75x75.912826887_a6f5.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/104\/0\/6665208\/il_170x135.912826887_a6f5.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/104\/0\/6665208\/il_570xN.912826887_a6f5.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/104\/0\/6665208\/il_fullxfull.912826887_a6f5.jpg","full_height":904,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":912826897,"hex_code":"A56A4E","red":165,"green":106,"blue":78,"hue":19,"saturation":52,"brightness":64,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1454117031,"listing_id":266059019,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/109\/0\/6665208\/il_75x75.912826897_tr2m.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/109\/0\/6665208\/il_170x135.912826897_tr2m.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/109\/0\/6665208\/il_570xN.912826897_tr2m.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/109\/0\/6665208\/il_fullxfull.912826897_tr2m.jpg","full_height":1003,"full_width":1500}],"Shop":{"shop_id":6665208,"shop_name":"Stonekettle","user_id":18362187,"creation_tsz":1324175379,"title":"Handmade wood products from Palmer, Alaska","announcement":null,"currency_code":"USD","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":"The Stonekettle Store is closed from 8\/18 to 8\/25. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m currently travelling and attending Worldcon2015 (the world science fiction convention) in Spokane, Washington.
